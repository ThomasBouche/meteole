## [0.3.0] - November, 2025

### Bugs

* `INDICATORS` and `INSTANT_INDICATORS` attributes of WeatherForecast object where not always in sync with
  the actual capabilities. Changed these attributes to properties that compute these lists dynamically
  from the `capabilities` attribute. Changed their name to lowercase (`indicators`, `instant_indicators`), since they are not constants anymore.
  (`DeprecationWarning` about use of `INDICATORS` and `INSTANT_INDICATORS`)
  See issue #54.
