## [0.2.5] - January, 2026
### Bugs
Depending on the indicators, the geographic boundary envelope of the indicators may have a height component or other components.
The current code does not take this into account.
See PR #62

## [0.2.4] - December, 2025
### Features
* Added a way to call the get_coverage method of WeatherForecast with floats for lat, long (instead of tuples only)
  to get forecast at a specific location (nearest grid point).
* Added a check on the lat, long parameters of get_coverage so that the closest gridpoint is used
* Added min and max available coordinates to get_coverage_description output
* Updated tests and documentation to reflect these changes

## [0.2.3] - November, 2025

### Bugs

* `INDICATORS` and `INSTANT_INDICATORS` attributes of WeatherForecast object where not always in sync with
  the actual capabilities. Changed these attributes to properties that compute these lists dynamically
  from the `capabilities` attribute. Changed their name to lowercase (`indicators`, `instant_indicators`), since they are not constants anymore.
  (`DeprecationWarning` about use of `INDICATORS` and `INSTANT_INDICATORS`)
  See issue #54.
